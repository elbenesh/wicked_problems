## About Me

### I am a freshman from Richmond, VA and went to Maggie Walker Governor's School. I plan to major in either Business Analytics or Mathematics. In terms of my hobbies, I am a huge sports fan and played soccer, basketball, and volleyball in high school. I also enjoy watching sports including my two favorite teams the New York Giants and Chelsea FC. Traveling is also one of my interests, which has led me to travel across the world including to Thailand, Cambodia, and Iceland.
